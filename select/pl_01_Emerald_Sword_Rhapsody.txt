I crossed the valleys
the dust of midlands
to search for the third key
to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar
the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun
light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory
I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals
and justice for all
〈♪〉
Finally happened
the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating
strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors
I found my lost way
over the stones
I reached the place
it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle
that prophecies told
the light will prevail
hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land
for the mountains
For the green valleys
where dragons fly
For the glory the power
to win the black lord
I will search for the
Emerald Sword
〈♪〉
Only a warrior
with a clear heart
could have the honour
to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior
I followed my way
led by the force
of cosmic soul
I can reach the sword
On the way the glory
I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals
and justice for all
For the king for the land
for the mountains
For the green valleys
where dragons fly
For the glory the power
to win the black lord
I will search for the
Emerald Sword
For the king for the land
for the mountains
For the green valleys
where dragons fly
For the glory the power
to win the black lord
I will search for the
Emerald Sword
